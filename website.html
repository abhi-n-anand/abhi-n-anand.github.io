    <h2>Hey There!</h2>
    <p class = "intro-text">
      I'm Abhi-- a rising third-year at UC Berkeley. I'm studying the intersection
      of Computer Science and Public Health. I could talk for days about either of
      those subjects, but I find the true me lies in my passion for the outdoors,
      spending time with friends, and my love for writing. Feel free to check out
      my resume, projects I've worked on, and tidbits about me below!
    </p>\

    <p class = "pronunciation">
      Want to know a trick to learn my name? Think of Dobby the elf.
      If you've never seen him before-- well, let's just say he's one of my
      favorite characters from Harry Potter (also the guy to the right).
      Got it? Good. Now, pop off the D from the front, say "obby"
      a few times to get the hang of it, and the fun is done!

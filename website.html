    I'm Abhi-- a rising third-year at UC Berkeley. I'm studying the intersection
    of Computer Science and Public Health. I could talk for days about either of
    those subjects, but I find the true me lies in my passion for the outdoors,
    spending time with friends, and my love for writing. Feel free to check out
    my resume, some of my projects, and some tidbits about me below!

  <p class = "pronunciation">
    Want to know a trick to learn my name? Think of Dobby the elf.
    If you've never seen him, it's the guy to the right over there.
    Got it? Good. Now, pop off the D from the front, and you're left
    with the perfect way to pronounce my name! </p>
